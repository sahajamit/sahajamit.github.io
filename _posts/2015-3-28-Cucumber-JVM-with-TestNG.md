title: Integrating Cucumber-JVM with TestNG
---

Cucumber-JVM has a native integration with JUnit to run the BDD scenarios. Junit is good framework which is more popular among developers to support their unit testing. When we talk about function automation testing then TestNG is a better choice to use as a test harness as it has more advanced features. Detailed comparison between these two frameworks can be found here [[http://www.mkyong.com/unittest/junit-4-vs-testng-comparison/]]
